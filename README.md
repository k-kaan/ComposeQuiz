# ComposeQuiz
This is a simple quiz in Material Design by Jetpack Compose as a Sample Android project. 

- The questions are loaded from a .json-File located in _res/raw_
- The view is recomposed by a LiveData observed as a state and sometimes with the _remember_ functionality

The app has a welcome screen for loading the questions from the repository and starting the quiz. After starting the quiz, the app jumps to the questions view with single-choice questions. The quiz ends with a stateless results screen, showing just the score for now.
